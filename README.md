# What?

Brainf*** compiler in Python

# Why?

Because why not? I also wanted to write an interpreter real quick.

# How?

You just need a moderately recent version of Python which supports match statements. I used 3.10.12

You can run the interpreter as follows:

```
python main.py <filepath>
```

where ```<filepath>``` points to the source code. See the ```bf``` folder for examples ripped straight from Wikipedia. Speaking of, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) for more information.
